			<p>The practice of keeping birds as pets has been around for centuries, but we're still a long way from knowing all there is to know about our feathered friends. Even so, the knowledge we have accumulated up to this point has brought to light many fascinating facts about the birds we share our lives with. Check out a few of these little-known bird facts; they'll inspire interest and appreciation for your pet.

				Your Bird Has Body Language. You Need to Learn It.
				You may know that a dog wagging its tail is friendly, but do you know how your pet bird acts when it is frightened or is considering biting you? Like humans, pet birds exhibit different body language depending on the species, but some behaviors are common in all birds.

				Tail Flaring. When your bird fans his tail feathers out, it is excited, over-excited or about to bite you. About half the time you handle a bird when it is flaring its tail, you're going to be bitten.
				Puffing Up. Usually, this means leave me alone, although a small amount of puffiness can mean the bird is relaxed.
				Dilated pupils. Visible in large birds, dilated pupils indicate a calm and docile bird. If the pupil is a pinprick size, the bird is agitated and about to bite.
				Raised crest. In crested birds, a raised crest indicates the bird is excited or happy to see you. A completely flat crest indicates fear.
				Preening. Only a relaxed bird preens. A bird preens to clean and groom its feathers.
			Beak Clicking. Your bird wants to be petted or is indicating pleasure.</p>
