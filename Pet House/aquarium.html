        <p>An aquarium (plural: aquariums or aquaria) is a vivarium of any size having at least one transparent side in
            which aquatic plants or animals are kept and displayed. Fishkeepers use aquaria to keep fish, invertebrates,
            amphibians, aquatic reptiles such as turtles, and aquatic plants. The term "aquarium", coined by English
            naturalist Philip Henry Gosse, combines the Latin root aqua, meaning water, with the suffix -arium, meaning
            "a place for relating to".[1] The aquarium principle was fully developed in 1850 by the chemist Robert
            Warington, who explained that plants added to water in a container would give off enough oxygen to support
            animals, so long as the numbers of animals did not grow too large.[2] The aquarium craze was launched in
            early Victorian England by Gosse, who created and stocked the first public aquarium at the London Zoo in
            1853, and published the first manual, The Aquarium: An Unveiling of the Wonders of the Deep Sea in 1854.[2]
            An aquarium is a water-filled tank in which fish swim about. Small aquariums are kept in the home by
            hobbyists. There are larger public aquariums in many cities. This kind of aquarium is a building with fish
            and other aquatic animals in large tanks. A large aquarium may have otters, turtles, dolphins, and other sea
            animals. Most aquarium tanks also have plants.[3]

            An aquarist owns fish or maintains an aquarium, typically constructed of glass or high-strength acrylic.
            Cuboid aquaria are also known as fish tanks or simply tanks, while bowl-shaped aquaria are also known as
            fish bowls. Size can range from a small glass bowl, under a gallon in volume, to immense public aquaria of
            several thousand gallons. Specialized equipment maintains appropriate water quality and other
            characteristics suitable for the aquarium's residents.</p>
